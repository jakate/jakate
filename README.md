### 🏂 Jaakko Tepponen
**`Fullstack Developer`**

I’m a fullstack developer with over 15 years of experience. I’ve worked over 10 years in a creative agency so I’ve seen a wide range of clients, industries and technologies. I have strong roots in frontend development and that’s where I feel most at home.

I’m a creative developer by heart and I love learning new skills.
